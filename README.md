# Method-Overiding
Method Overriding :
---------------------
Writing two or more methods in the super and sub class in such a way that method signature(method name along with method parameter) of both the methods  must be same in the super and sub classes. 

While working with method overriding generally we can't change the return type of the method but from JDK 1.5 onwards we can change the return type of the method in only one case that is known as Co-Variant.

Without inheritance method overriding is not possible that means if there is no inheritance there is no method overriding.

What is the advantage of Method Overriding ?

The advantage of Method Overriding is, each class is specifying its own specific behavior.
